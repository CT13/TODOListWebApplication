It's fun coding... 

Here is simple Web Application coded in HTML and JavaScript, TODO list apps that makes note of what we want to do. We may need this simple but dynamic app in our daily work to make a notes and check completed ones. The data is not stored anywhere, upon refresh of browser, the entered data will vanish. In future, I will enhance this to store and open old data entered by users.

I have hosted this application in my cloud VM. It uses HTTP protocol and port 301.
